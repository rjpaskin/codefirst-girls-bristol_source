title: Names & Variables
---

So far we've used irb as a clever calculator, by working with values directly. Programming becomes a lot more powerful when you're able to give values **names**.

A **name** is just something that you can use to refer to a value. In ruby you create a name by using the assignment operator, `=`.

{% highlight ruby %}
age = 5
{% endhighlight %}

You can change the value associated with a name at any point. It doesn't even have to be the same type of value as the first value assigned to the name. Here we change the value associated with `age` to a string:

{% highlight ruby %}
age = "almost three"
{% endhighlight %}

## Types of name

There are various different types of name in ruby:

* **local variables** e.g. `age`: Local variables begin with a lower-case letter. They're all we'll be using for now.
* **constants** e.g. `PI`: Any name that starts with a capital letter is deemed to be a constant. Ruby will complain if you try to change its value at a later date.
* **instance variables** e.g. `@name`: Instance variables start with a single `@` sign. They're used to store values inside objects. More later.
* **class variables** e.g. `@@count`: Class variables start with two `@@` signs. They're used to store values relevant to a set of objects. More on this later too.
* **global variables** e.g. `$last_error`: Global variables start with a `$` sign. They're available anywhere in your program. Relying on global variables is normally a bad idea.

For the moment, we will just be using local variables. The important thing to take from the above tables is that **local variables must start with a lower-case letter**.

## String interpolation

String interpolation is a way of taking a variable and putting it inside a string.

To write a string in ruby you can either use `'` or `"`.

{% highlight ruby %}
string1 = 'hello'
string2 = "hello"
{% endhighlight %}

In the code above, string1 and string2 are exactly the same. The difference between `'` and `"` is that `"` allows you to do **string interpolation**:

{% highlight ruby %}
age = 5
age_description = "My age is #{age}." #=> "My age is 5."
{% endhighlight %}

Any ruby expression inside the `#{ }` will be evaluated and inserted into the string. Here we gave it the variable `age`, which points to the value `5`. As `5` is a value it evaluates to itself, so 5 is inserted into the string.

1. With your partner, decide what each of the following instructions will do. Test to see if you're right in irb.

{% highlight ruby %}
a = 1

a

a+1

a

a = a + 1

a

b = "hello"

b

c = b.capitalize

b

c

d = "hello"

e = d.capitalize!

d

e

name = "Dave"

f = "Hello #{name}! "

f

name = "Sarah"

f

f * 5

2. (Extension for pairs who finish early.)[Note: this exercise has a lot more to do with maths than programming. If you don't get it don't worry!]

    Consider the expression
    ```
    x = (2 + 5*x - x**2)/5
    ```
    1. Let `x = 1.1`
    2. Write `x = (2 + 5*x - x**2)/5` and then evaluate this multiple times (using the up arrow in irb)
    3. What happens? Can you explain why?
    4. Let `x = 1` and do the same thing. What happens and why?
