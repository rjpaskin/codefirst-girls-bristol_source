Google Analytics is an analytics service provided for free by Google. It allows you get an overview of how many people are visiting your site, where they come from, what they do on your site, and much more. 

### How it works

To use Google Analytics you need to place a snippet of javascript (that they provide) on each of the HTML pages on your site. When a user visits the page, the javascript sends a message to the Google Analytics site logging the visit.
