### Before you start: verifying github email address

Today we're going to be putting up your first site using [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - a free hosting solution provided by
GitHub.

In order for this to work you need to have **verified your email address
with GitHub**.

{% exercise %}
* Log into GitHub.
* If you see a warning at the top that you haven't verified your
email address, follow the instructions to do that now.
* If not, you're good to go!

### CSS

* CSS is used to change the appearance of your webpage (whereas HTML is used to describe the structure).
* CSS is composed of *selectors* and *rules*.
* Selectors can be *tags* (e.g. `p`, `h1`), *classes* (e.g. `.big-button`, `.navigation-link`) and *ids* (e.g. `#header`, `#footer`), or any combination of the three.
* Rules specify *properties* (like `color`, `font-family`) of the selected element with *values* (like `red`, `20px`, `left`)
* You can narrow down what elements a set of rules applies to by specifying one or more selectors from their parent element(s), separated by a space.

### The command line

* The *command line* is a way to issue commands *using text* to your computer, much like you do with the mouse and clicking buttons.
* You can find out what folder you're currently in with the `pwd` command.
* You can list the contents of a folder with the `ls` command.
* You can change which folder you're in with the `cd` command.
* You can create a folder with the `mkdir` command.
