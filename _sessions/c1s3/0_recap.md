### Before you start: verifying github email address

Today we're going to be putting up your first site using [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - a free hosting solution provided by
GitHub.

In order for this to work you need to have **verified your email address
with GitHub**.

{% exercise %}
<ol>
  <li>Log into GitHub.</li>
  <li>If you see a warning at the top that you haven't verified your
email address, follow the instructions to do that now.</li>
  <li>If not, you're good to go!</li>
</ol>
{% endexercise %}

### Review exercise

{% exercise %}
<ol>
  <li>Open the comand line</li>
  <li>Navigate to your 'first_site' folder (cd/ls)</li>
  <li>Open 'first_site/index.html' in Sublime Text</li>
  <li>Make a change to the file</li>
  <li>Save the changes and push to github ("gitgit save", "gitgit
push")</li>
  <li>Log into github and check you can see your changes</li>
</ol>
