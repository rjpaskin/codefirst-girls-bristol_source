title:  "Recap from last time"

### The web

* A webpage is just a collection of files: HTML, CSS & Javascript.
* We can edit these files locally.
* We can create them locally (using a text editor) and view then in a browser.

### HTML

* HTML is made up of a set of nested tags, which look like this: `<p>`.
* Tags can either come in pairs: `<p>...</p>`, or as a *self-closing* tag: `<img>`.
* You can add links with the `<a>` tag: `<a href="path/to/the/page">Link text</a>`.
* You can add images with the `<img>` tag: `<img src="path/to/the/image.jpg" alt="description of the image">`.
* Lists are made with the `<ol>` (numbered) or `<ul>` (bullets) tags. Each item in the list is surrounded by `<li>` tags.
* Headings are made with the `<h1>` - `<h6>` tags, where lower numbers are more important.
* Tables are constructed with the `<table>` tag, with each row contained within a `<tr>` tag, and each cell within a `<td>` tag.

### Check your work from last time

{% exercise %}
* Go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/code61/learning_html) from the last session.

* Click on the files below to see the solution.
