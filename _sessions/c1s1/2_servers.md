title: Web servers
---

You can think of the internet as a massive network of computers that can send files to one another. The computers that hold web pages are called _servers_. **Servers are large, specialised computers that are permanently connected to the internet.**

Once the address of the web server has been found, and your request is forwarded on to it, the web server will interpret your request and send back one or more files. We now look at the technology involved in this process.

### Static vs dynamic sites

There are two main possibilities server-side: either your site is static or dynamic.

* In a static site all the pages are pre-prepared and the web server just sends them to the browser.
* In a dynamic site the pages are prepared on-the-fly pulling information out of a database depending on what the user asked for.

Most of the sites you can think of will be dynamic sites (e.g. [Facebook](facebook.com), [Reddit](reddit.com), [Amazon](amazon.com), ..).

### Server-side technologies

There are many options for building a dynamic server-side site - you're pretty much free to do what you like. Some common choices are:
