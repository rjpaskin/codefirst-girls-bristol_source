title: Creating an HTML page
---

One of the nice things about HTML is you don't need any fancy software to test it out on your laptop: all you need is a text editor and a web browser.

{% exercise %}
1. Inside your `coding_course` folder create another folder called `first_site`.
2. Open Sublime Text.
3. Write "Hello"
4. Save the file as `index.html` in the `first_site` folder
5. Open `index.html` in Chrome. Depending on your version of Chrome
    * File > Open ...
    * Cmd-O (Mac) or Ctrl-O (Windows)

### Why index.html?

In the old days of the web, navigating a website was a lot more like moving around the folder system on your laptop. You would go to a base site and there would just be a list of the files and folders available: an index. Because of this `index.html` is still the default file that a server will serve when you navigate to a folder in the web browser.

{% exercise %}
1. Go back to 'index.html' in Sublime Text.
2. Change the text to
{% highlight html %}
<h1>Hello</h1>
{% endhighlight %}
3. Go back to 'index.html' in Chrome and refresh the page (Cmd-R for Mac, F5 on Windows)
{% endexercise %}

This is your first line of HTML. It has an open tag and a close tag. They tell your browser to display the text in-between as a heading.
